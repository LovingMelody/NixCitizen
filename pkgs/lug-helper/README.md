## Star Citizen's Linux Users Group Helper Script

This is a script meant to help optimize Star Citizen on star citizen.
A lot of the automatic setup features do not work on linux but I have decided to include this here anyways, it is still useful. This script has utilities for managing your lutris install as well as general Star Citizen setup.
You can find more details about the script at [starcitizen-lug/lug-helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper).
