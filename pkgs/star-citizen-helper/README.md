# Experimental Helper

## What it does

This script detects if a newer update is available by parsing the [RSS Feed](https://status.robertsspaceindustries.com/index.xml) for updates and comparing it to the build manifest. If an update is detected, it clears the shader cache. This currently only works for LIVE and has not been well tested.
